Nth node from end of linked list 
Easy (GfG)

Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9
Output: 8
Explanation: In the first example, there
are 9 nodes in linked list and we need
to find 2nd node from end. 2nd node
from end os 8.  

int getNthFromLast(Node *head, int n)
{
       // Your code here
       Node *curr = head;
       int count = 0;
       int res = 0;
       while(curr != NULL)
       {
           count++;
           curr = curr->next;
       }
       curr = head;
       
       if(count < n)
       {
            return -1;
       }
       
       while(count-- > n )
       {
           curr = curr->next;
       }
      
       res = curr->data;
       
       return res;
       
}

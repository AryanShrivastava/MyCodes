Identical Linked Lists
Basic (GfG)

Given two Singly Linked List of N and M nodes respectively. 
The task is to check whether two linked lists are identical or not. 
Two Linked Lists are identical when they have same data and with same arrangement too.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList1: 1->2->3->4->5->6
LinkedList2: 99->59->42->20
Output: Not identical 

bool areIdentical(struct Node *head1, struct Node *head2)
{
    Node *curr1 = head1;
    Node *curr2 = head2;
    
    while(curr1 != NULL && curr2 != NULL)
    {
        if(curr1->data != curr2->data)
            return false;
        
        
        curr1 = curr1->next;
        curr2 = curr2->next;
    }
    
    return (curr1 == NULL && curr2 == NULL);
}

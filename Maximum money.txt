Maximum money 
very basic (GfG)

Given a street of N houses (a row of houses), each house having K amount of money kept inside; now there is a thief who is going to steal this money but he has a constraint/rule that he cannot steal/rob two adjacent houses. Find the maximum money he can rob.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5 , K = 10
Output:
30
Explanation:
The Robber can rob from the first, third
and fifth houses which will result in 30.

class Solution {
  public:
    int maximizeMoney(int N , int K) {
        // code here
        int sum =0;
        
            for(int i=0 ;i< N; i = i+2)
            {
                sum = sum + K;
            }
    return sum;
    }
};

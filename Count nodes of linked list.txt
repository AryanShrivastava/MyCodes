Count nodes of linked list
Basic (GfG)

Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the 
linked list is 5, which is its length.

class Solution
{
    public:
    int getCount(struct Node* head){
    
    Node *curr = head;
    int count = 0;
       while(curr != NULL)
       {
               count++;
               curr = curr->next;
       }
     return count;
    }
};

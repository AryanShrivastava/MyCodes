Absolute List Sorting 
Easy (GfG)

Given a linked list L of N nodes, sorted in ascending order based on the absolute values of its data. Sort the linked list according to the actual values.
Ex: Input : 1 -> -2 -> -3 -> 4 -> -5 
      Output: -5 -> -3 -> -2 -> 1 -> 4

/* The structure of the Linked list Node is as follows:
struct Node
{
    Node* next;
    int data;
}; */

/*Your method shouldn't print anything
 it should transform the passed linked list */
void sortList(Node** head)
{
    // Your Code Here
    
    Node *prev = (*head);
    Node *curr = (*head)->next;
    
    while(curr != NULL)
    {
        if(curr->data < prev->data)
        {
            prev->next = curr->next;
            
            curr->next = (*head);
            (*head) = curr;
            
            curr = prev;
            
        }
        
        else
            prev = curr;
        
        curr = curr->next;
    
    }
    
    
}

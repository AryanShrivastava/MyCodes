Delete Alternate Nodes
Basic (GfG)

Given a Singly Linked List of size N, delete all alternate nodes of the list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6
Output: 1->3->5
Explanation: Deleting alternate nodes
results in the linked list with elements
1->3->5.

void deleteAlt(struct Node *head){
    // Code here
    Node *Next = head->next;
    Node *curr = head;
    
    while(curr != NULL && Next != NULL)
    {
        curr->next = Next->next;
        free(Next);
        curr = curr->next;
        
        if(curr != NULL)
        {
            Next = curr->next;
        }
    }
}

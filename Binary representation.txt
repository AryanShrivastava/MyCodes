Binary representation
very basic (GfG)

Write a program to print Binary representation of a given number N.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
Output:
000000000000000000000000000010
Explanation:
The binary representation of 2 is '10'
but we need to print in 30 bits so append
remaining 0's in the left.

class Solution
{
public:
    string getBinaryRep(int N)
    {
        string str;
        for(int i = 29 ; i>=0 ; i--)
        {
            int p = (N>>i)&1;
            str.push_back('0'+p);
        }
        return str;
    }
};

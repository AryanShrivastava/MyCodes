Check If Circular Linked List 
Basic (GfG)

Given a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not. A linked list is called circular if it not NULL terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. An empty linked list is considered as circular.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
(the first and last node is connected,
i.e. 5 --> 1)
Output: 1

bool isCircular(Node *head)
{
    if(head == NULL)
    return true;

    Node *node = head->next;

    while( node != NULL && node != head)
    {
        node = node->next;
    }
    
    return (node == head); 
}

Delete node in Doubly Linked List
basic (GfG)

Given a doubly linked list and a position. The task is to delete a node from given position in a doubly linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList = 1 <--> 3 <--> 4 
x = 3
Output: 1 3  
Explanation: After deleting the node at
position 3 (position starts from 1),
the linked list will be now as 1->3.

class Solution
{
    public:
    Node* deleteNode(Node *head_ref, int x)
    {
    struct Node *del = head_ref;
       x = x-1;
       
       while(x--)
        del = del->next;
    
      if(head_ref == NULL || del == NULL)
        return NULL;
     
      if(head_ref == del)
        head_ref = del->next;
     
      if(del->next != NULL)
        del->next->prev = del->prev;
     
      if(del->prev != NULL)
        del->prev->next = del->next;     
     
      free(del);
      return head_ref;
    }
};
